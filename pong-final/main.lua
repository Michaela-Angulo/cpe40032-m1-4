    Pong Remake

    -- Main Program --



    Originally programmed by Atari in 1972. Features two
    paddles, controlled by players, with the goal of getting
    the ball past your opponent's edge. First to 10 points wins.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on
    modern systems.

-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

push = require 'push'

-- the "Class" library we're using will allow us to represent anything in
-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and
-- methods

-- our Paddle class, which stores position and dimensions for each Paddle
-- and the logic for rendering them
require 'Paddle'

-- our Ball class, which isn't much different than a Paddle structure-wise
-- but which will mechanically function very differently
require 'Ball'

-- size of our actual window
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1280

    Called just once at the beginning of the game; used to set up
    game objects, variables, etc. and prepare the game world.

--[[
    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example. In this case, we only need to worry
    about calling out to `push` to handle the resizing. Takes in a `w` and
    `h` variable representing width and height, respectively.
]]
function love.resize(w, h)
    push:resize(w, h)
end

--[[
    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
    game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any
    changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
    across system hardware.
